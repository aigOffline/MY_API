# MY_API

My first official API about climate change, after searching climate change API in the Russian language, I couldnâ€™t find anything, so I decided to implement my own.

I published in https://rapidapi.com/provider/6022783/apis/climate-change76/analytics

For deployment I used herokuapp https://climatechange01.herokuapp.com/
